# Simple tool for listing the path environment vairable

I needed a way to list the paths in $PATH so I wrote a short rust program to do that (lspath)

The program can be installed with cargo:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/mrmaveric/lspath
```

And run:
```sh
lspath
C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7
C:\Program Files\Alacritty\
C:\Python312\Scripts\
C:\Python312\
...
```
